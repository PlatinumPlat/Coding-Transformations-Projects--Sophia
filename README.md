# ❓ About
These two coding projects were created for a school assignment while I was in Grade 7; Mrs. De Luca's Class; Crosby Heights Public School.

# 📝 Descriptions
*Project #1*: My first project transforms a set of 3 inputted coordinates that form a triangle across the x and y axis. The original, first image, and second image are graphed on a grid to the right of the coordinate inputs.

*Project #2*: My second project is designed to stimulate to a heart monitor. Given 10 measurements of beats per minute across a 10 minute period, the program displays a line graph that reflects the user's heartbeat frequency in an effective format.
